# ESP_Thermostat

This is a Thermostat controller for ESP8266 using Homie (with my [HomieNodeCollection](../../../HomieNodeCollection)) and Automaton to provide a Thermostat module including an 128x64 OLED display.

**This project is currently on hold, see  [ESP-Touch](../../../ESP-Touch) for a project that can be used as Thermostat with local TouchControl and support for a Homeautomation system like OpenHAB.**
